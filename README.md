# sketch-2-render-CarryUNet

## Use Case
In SaaS game production, items are constantly created within the same art style.
For example, DarkOrbit spaceships.
Designing concepts for these variations is a repetitive and recurring task.

## The Tool
A lightweight CNN enables artists to train and generate new artwork from sketches.
They maintain control over shapes and structures, while detail rendering is acceleratedâ€”supporting faster and more efficient design exploration.
